## 🧭 Overview
This project is a **personal portfolio website** created by **Eren Doğu Fırat**, a Geomatics Engineering student passionate about **GIS**, **Photogrammetry**, and **3D Mapping**.  
It showcases my professional background, projects, and technical skills while integrating an **interactive web map** developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

The website has two main parts:  
- **Home & About Section:** Personal introduction, experiences, and projects  
- **Map Section:** Interactive mapping application powered by geospatial technologies

## 💡 Key Features
- Responsive design with smooth animations using **AOS (Animate On Scroll)**  
- Integrated **Spline 3D viewer** for interactive 3D visuals  
- Elegant UI with gradient effects and hover transitions  
- Clickable and expandable experience & project cards  
- Custom pop-up system for displaying detailed content  
- AI integration for enhancing visual and interactive design components  
- A separate **map interface** (map.html) using modern web mapping tools

## 🧠 Artificial Intelligence Usage
AI was utilized in multiple stages of this project:
- **Content Optimization:** Descriptions, project texts, and animations were refined using AI-generated language models for clarity and tone.  
- **Design Enhancement:** Layout and user flow suggestions were derived from AI-based UX analysis tools.  
- **Map Integration Support:** AI-assisted JavaScript code generation and optimization for map interactions (map.js).
